        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Built an allocation engine for a leading Energy& Resource Industry to source Business Intelligence data from 
        Oracle cloud PPM every week into UCM server and using Data Sync to upload, and manage data from files (CSV 
        and XLSX) to various relational sources (tables, views, SQL statements).
        * Developed SQL stored procedures/packages to intelligently wrangle the expense and labor data to select valid 
        records and allocating it into different types and further processing it to calculate accurate rates. This integration 
        engine helped in the automation of weekly tracking of expense and labor costs to bring down the operation time 
        and manual effort from 45 hours to 20 minutes.
        * Successfully implemented 100% in-sprint automation in Java using the Selenium tool for Customer Account 
        Setup, Pricing Setup, Invoice creation and performed conversion end to end testing for various entities for a USbased Health Care Insurance
        Company. Reduced turnaround time from 2 days to 2 hours.
        * Interacted with stakeholders to gather requirements, implementation planning, POC evaluations, System 
        Integration Testing, User Acceptance Testing and rollout, and production deployments


  - title: Business Analyst

        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Worked for a leading healthcare, life science, and services client to expand the current EBS footprint into services 
        procurement, procurement contracts and supplier, receivables, life cycle management. This implementation 
        enabled the client to move away from their current legacy systems to more stable architecture and its rollout over 
        21 countries worldwide. 
        * Performed data cleansing, transformation and validations for successful conversion of complex data sets from 
        legacy system to Oracle using advanced SQL resulting in 99% conversion efficiency. Engineered development 
        of ETL pipelines (inbound and outbound) from multiple sources to Oracle EBS/Oracle Cloud to reduce the time 
        and effort required for the integration process.
        * Analyzed and built business intelligence (BI) reports to increase operations efficiency by 25% using Oracle BI 
        Publisher Tool.
        * Programmed backend API s for client's e-commerce website resulting in the multiplication of sales of the products by 20%.
        * Provided service as a single point of contact for the data migration activities across various systems and instances

        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Pre-processing of raw Electricity Price data of three different energy markets, its feature extraction and Predictive 
        analysis of Electricity Price using a Multi-kernel extreme learning machine and its optimization using the Water 
        Cycle Algorithm and other statistical approaches in MATLAB. 
        * Stock Prediction Model

        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Drew insights from synthetic Power Quality distorted data, extracted its features and built a model in MATLAB 
        that uses a unique method of Online Sequential Extra Learning Machine. The model forecasts PQ failures with an 
        accuracy of 99.7%. 
        * Explored architectures like KNN, PNN, CNN, SVM, and other Neural Networks and ensemble models for 
        studying the properties and pattern of Power Quality events and facilitated a comparative analysis of these 
        traditional models with OS-ELM algorithm. 
        * Future prediction of PQ failures and classification of statistical features of PQ events can assist in reducing power 
        fluctuation in industry and home. It can prevent failure or malfunctioning of protective electrical and electronic 
        devices, damage to computer files, and memory failure of sympathetic loads.
